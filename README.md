# Moar FPS

A simple mod for more fps.  
In fact, as many fps as you want.

## This does not change actual FPS, only showing fake number as a joke.

## Config
Install [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to access mod config, or edit `config/moarfps.json5` file.

### Options:
- `Get better FPS?`: Toggle mod,
- `Desired FPS`: Number shown as fps,
- `Make it appear less fake?`: Fluctuate fps by set amount,
- `How much less fake?`: Fluctuation limits.

### Compatibility:
- Sodium & Sodium-Extra: Yes
- Optifine: Partial (average fps isn't affected)
- Likely other HUD mods too, unless they're using own method of counting FPS
